# SI507_Professor_Recommendation_System

## Getting Started
This github repository is a simple user interactive professor recommendation system developed for prospective PhD students. The user has to select the "University" and specify the Research Area they are interesed in to get the list of all professors. We conduct web scraping on the https://www.usnews.com/ website to extract information on all the schools based in the United States of America. All the useful information about the professors is cached in a JSON file, and can be used directly rather than web scrapping or calling APIs everytime the user interacts with the system.
